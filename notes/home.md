# Welcome

This is the [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so) vault of lessons learned about a variety of topics, mostly technical.

## Why?



"[Learned helplessness](https://www.betterup.com/blog/learned-helplessness) is the behavior exhibited by a subject after enduring repeated aversive stimuli beyond their control." With enough practice, you can break bad habits and learn new things -- potentially making the world better for yourself and everyone around you. Don't be helpless, be helpful.
